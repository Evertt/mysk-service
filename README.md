# sv

Everything you need to build a Svelte project, powered by [`sv`](https://github.com/sveltejs/cli).

## Creating a project

If you're seeing this, you've probably already done this step. Congrats!

```sh
# create a new project
npx sv create my-app
```

To recreate this project with the same configuration:

```sh
# recreate this project
npx sv@1.1.0 create --template minimal --types ts --add vitest="usages:unit,component" tailwindcss="plugins:typography,forms" sveltekit-adapter="adapter:auto" drizzle="database:sqlite+sqlite:libsql" better-auth="demo:password" paraglide="languageTags:en,nl+demo:no" ai-tools="ide:claude-code,opencode,vscode,other+delivery:plugin+tools:mcp,svelte-code-writer,svelte-core-bestpractices,svelte-file-editor+mcpSetup:remote" experimental="features:async,remoteFunctions" --no-install ./
```

## Adding features

Add features to your project with `sv add`:

```sh
npx sv add
```

For example, to add Tailwind CSS:

```sh
npx sv add tailwindcss
```

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```sh
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Demo login

Everything except the login page needs a signed-in user. `pnpm run db:seed` creates two demo
users, both with the password `fieldworks-demo` (set in `DEMO_PASSWORD` in
`src/lib/server/db/seed.ts`):

| Name        | Email                        |
| ----------- | ---------------------------- |
| Avery Admin | `admin@fieldworks.example`   |
| Pat Planner | `planner@fieldworks.example` |

These are local demo accounts; don't seed them into a real deployment.

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```sh
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/adapters) for your target environment.
